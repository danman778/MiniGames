One of the last games I was developing, and was left 
unfinished as I started working more in Python. The end
goal was for this to run the game memory, where players flip 
over cards and try to make matches, but players also move cards
around on their turn, hence the 'swap' in the name.
The only completed parts are the starting menu and 
the homemade graphics library for the shapes on the cards.
