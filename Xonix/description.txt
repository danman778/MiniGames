In this game, you move a red square around to fill in a map, without 
letting the balls bouncing around hit you or your tail. Fill in 
at least 75 percent of the map to beat the level and add another ball.
Get hit three times, and the game is over.
The algorithm that decides where gets filled is actually just a slight
modification to the maze solver in mazer.r from the maze solvers folder.
