This is a couple of maze solvers I developed. In the first,
mazer.1, the user places blocks and then the computer tries to
solve the given maze, highlighting the path in red if there is one.
The second solver, mazer.r, is slightly more sophisticated, as now
the user gets the option to start with a random percentage of the
board filled (helpful on large boards), and the solver not only marks
the solution in red, but also marks all accesible squares in a lighter
shade of gray.
