Three versions of the snake game. The first, snake.cpp (and the compiled snake.exe), 
is an average snake game, similar to one you would find on google.
In auto_snake, instead of you playing the game, the computer maps the path
and moves the snake from apple to apple, occasionally choosing strange paths
because it's algorithm is built out of a generic maze solver.
Finally, in toggle_snake, you can switch off control between the player
and computer with the press of a button, allowing the computer to get you out
of a tight spot.
