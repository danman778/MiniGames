A simple 3D graphics project. After running the program, 
clicking anywhere on the graphics window will create a cube in that location.
Arrow keys can be used to change the camera location, and the plus and minus
signs on the right of the graphics window zoom in and out.
Placing just a few blocks already causes strain to the graphics engine 
(an innate problem with the language and libraries I am using for graphics),
so I didn't put a lot of work into developing the project past functionality.
