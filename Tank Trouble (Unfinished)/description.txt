The goal behind this project was to make a game where two players
would maneuver tanks around a 2d map and shoot bullets that ricochet
off of walls, where each would try to hit thier opponent before getting 
hit themselves. Unfortunately, the drawing speed of the graphics software
used throttles game speed to the degree that the game wouldn't be very fun, 
so the idea was scrapped. The map generation, tank motion, and bullet motion 
function, as well as most of the collision, but the collision between tanks
and bullets never got coded and tank/wall collision doesn't work well on corners.
